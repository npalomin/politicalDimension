> '...pedestrian highwalks
[...] aimed to facilitate public
life separated from street-level traffic', were 'envisioned as an
elevated network disseminated throughout
the City, the plan was never realised and the
pedways for the most part were not built
beyond the Barbican boundaries. As a
result, the pedways expose pedestrians to
bleak, disorienting landscapes that isolate
Barbican residents and visitors, rather than
inviting new flows of interaction, hybridity
and intensity.'
(Trangos et al., 2014)

> 'The political economy of a city is not confined, after all, to questions of who owns what, but how this spatial economy is regulated in terms of access, exclusion and control [...] The privatizing logic that has colonized this city, he argues, means that really accessible public spaces have been steadily degraded and destroyed, while 'pseudo-public spaces - sumptuary malls, office centers, cultural acropolises and so on - are full of invisible signs warning off the underclass "Other"'
(Tonkiss, 2005)
