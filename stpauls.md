> 'Politics, like other social relations, unfolds in space. To think about politics ans power is nearly always to invoke a set of spatial
relations: from the surface of the body to the distribution of property, the spatial order of the senate chamber [...].These are real spaces which are also diagrams of social power.'
(Tonkiss, 2005)

>'...we can sketch three ideal-types of public space, which in turn capture three different senses of being with others in public. These three types are: (1) the square - representive collective belonging; (2) the cafe - representing social exchange; and (3) the street - representing informal enconunter.'[...]'...as a site of collective belonging (public space affords) 'equal and in principle free access to all users and citizens.[...](public space of social exchange) may privately owned and regulated, but still involve a sense of being in public.[...]Public space, third, can refer to more mundane spaces of communal use: places that we share as a matter of fact. [...]  the street- as the basic unit of public life in the city- is the best and most obvious example of shared public space in which individuals are brought to interact...'
(Tonkiss, 2005)

> '...the morning of 15
October (2012), protesters aligned with the
global Occupy movement stormed the London Stock Exchange—a symbolic
heart of the local and global financial
sector (Occupy LSX 2011). Forced by
police to retreat, protesters established a
makeshift tent city along the steps of St
Paul’s Cathedral, where they set up temporary
residences, educational programmes
and political working groups'
(Trangos et al., 2014)

> 'The public realm can be simply defined as a place where strangers meet [...]The public realm is, more over, a place.[...]The most important fact about the public realm is what happens in it.'
(Sennett, 2010)
