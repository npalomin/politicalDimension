> 'The City voting structure as it currently exists. Business votes currently outnumber residential votes by 75%. Proportional voting based on employee numbers means that business management chooses which staff vote for them. Only members of livery companies, of which 50% still do not accept female membership can, be eligible for and, vote in the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of the City.'(Trangos et al., 2014)

> 'Cities should ideally be organised around collective interests, within which residents in egalitarian democracies should have equal rights, benefits and share common values [...] a collective making of the city presupposes potential conflict among individuals who nevertheless share a vision of what public interest is. The project of city-making consists of defining and providing a space for the expression of mutual interests in the form of public space.'(Trangos et al., 2014)

>'...what passes as public space increasingly is an addendum to private devlopment -the atrium, piazza [...]. Offered as empty civic gestures by developers [...] these bits of "dead public space" too often are perceived as blank, forbidding or alienating by potential public users.'(Tonkiss, 2005)

> 'When the city operates as an open system – incorporating principles of porosity of territory, narrative indeterminacy and incomplete form – it becomes democratic not in a legal sense, but as physical experience. In the past, thinking about democracy focused on issues of formal governance, today it focuses on citizenship and issues of participation. Participation is an issue that has everything to do with the physical city and its design.'(Sennett, 2006)

> 'The lobbies of corporate office blocks and towers form parts of the City’s pristine, guarded boundaries. Blank walls of concrete and glass contain interior-oriented worlds that are uninviting to passers-by [...] Although glass lobbies may be transparent, security guards, surveillance cameras and immaculate furnishings signal that these spaces function as discriminating thresholds and status symbols, rather than as connected parts of the ‘public city’'.(Trangos et al., 2014)
