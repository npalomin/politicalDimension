> Almost 2000 years ago, what is now the City of London had a Roman city wall that defined its perimeter. 
Even though the wall has come down, the City still deploys a spectrum of physical, symbolic and virtual
elements to maintain this boundary, including the surveillance network termed the ‘Ring of Steel’
(Trangos et al., 2014)

> The boundary is an edge where things end; the border is an edge where different groups interact [...] territories consist 
[...] of boundaries and borders – in cities, most simply, there is a contrast between gated communities and complex, open streets
(Sennett, 2006)
